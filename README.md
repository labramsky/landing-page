<h1>Landing Page Project</h1>

<h2>Overview</h2>

I used the starter project's HTML and CSS styling for the Landing Page project, modifying the JavaScript file. The project had three main goals:
<ol>
    <li>Programatically build the navigation bar using the pageâ€™s section headers</li>
    <li>Scroll to anchors from navigation using scroll functions</li>
    <li>Add "active" class to section in viewport upon scrolling</li>
</ol>

<h2>Design Decisions</h2>

<h3>Navigation Bar</h3>

The main function to build the navigation bar is `buildNav()` which is called once the page is fully loaded in `setUpSectionNav()`. This function creates list elements to build the navigation's unordered list, and uses the helper function `createSectionNavLink()` to create link elements using the sections' data tags. Since there are no images to load in the page, I used the `DOMContentLoaded` event. Using the event along with the keyword `defer` in the HTML `<script>` tag, I can ensure that the DOM elements needed to build the navigation will exist at the time the function is called. 

<h3>Scroll To Sections</h3>

When a section link is clicked in the navigation, the main function called to scroll is `scrollToSelectedLinkSection()`. Since we want to stop the default event on the click, I used `preventDefault()`. This allows for an initial check that a link has been selected, and then it calls `getSelectedLinkSection()`, which returns the selected section. Once we have the section to scroll to, the function calls `scrollToSection()` to scroll to the selected section into the view. 

<h3>Active Section</h3>

A scroll listener calling `makeSectionInViewActive()` is used to keep track of which section is in the view and set the section to "`active`." When `setUpSectionNav()` is called on page load, it calls the `setSectionPositionData()`function, which uses `getElementPosition()` to get the top and bottom position of each section on the page. On the scroll event, the `isSectionInViewport` will compare the window's scrollY to the position of each section to find the section that is currently in the viewport. If a section is in the viewport, `addActiveClass()` will add the "`active`" class from the `classList` of the section and its corresponding nav link, otherwise `removeActiveClass()` will remove it.
